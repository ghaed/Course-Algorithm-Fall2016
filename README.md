# Fun-With-Algorithms
Repository storing my codes for the fun algorithms I have implemented


## Divide and Conquer Algorithms
###FindSecond: 
Finds the 2nd largest element in an array with only n+long(n)-1 comparisons
###InversionCount:
Counts the number of inversions in an array
###QuickSort:
Sorts an array using the n*log(n) in-place quick sort

## Graph Algorithms
###DijkstraShortestPath
Implement's Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Both the naive O(m*n) version and the more efficient heap-based O(m*lon(n)) algorithms are implemented
###KargerMinimumCut
Implements Karger's minimum-cut algorithm. The fast algorithm uses a randomized approach to find the "weak" edges of the graph
###StronglyConnectedComponents
Uses a depth-first-search style algorithm to find the strongly-connected components of a graph. Both the recursive implementation and the stack-based iterative approach are coded up
